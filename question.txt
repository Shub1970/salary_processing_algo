->An organization needs to develop a salary processing application
  for its staff
->At present it ha an engineering dividion only where engineers and 
  Managers work. Every Engineer reports to some Manager.
  Every Manager can also work like an engineer
->The logic for processing salary for Engineers and Managers are 
  different as they have different salary heads
->In future, it may add Directors to the team. Then every Manager 
  will report to some Director. Every Director could also work like
  a Manager
->The logic for processing salary for Director will also be distinct
->Futher, in future it may open other division, like Sales division,
  and expand the workforce
